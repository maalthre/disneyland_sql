Australia ranks third with 4,679 reviews, showing a significant but smaller contribution compared to the US and UK. Canada and India round out the top five, with 2,235 and 1,511 reviews, respectively. This suggests that the majority of reviews come from English-speaking countries, with a noticeable international reach extending to places like Canada and India."

Additionally, December also has a high review volume, with 3,874 reviews, possibly due to holiday visits and end-of-year travel. Other months with relatively high volumes include October (3,764) and June (3,590). These months suggest that peak tourist seasons, including summer and holidays, generate the most review activity."

Disneyland Hong Kong follows with 18.42% of reviews mentioning lines, and these reviews have an average rating of 4.22, suggesting that although lines are a concern, they do not significantly detract from the overall visitor experience. Disneyland Paris has the lowest percentage of line-related mentions at 16.2%, and the average rating for these reviews is 3.98, which is the lowest among the three branches. This suggests that while lines are less frequently discussed, they tend to result in more negative feedback compared to the other locations. In conclusion, while lines are a common point of discussion, visitors in Disneyland California appear the most forgiving of wait times, whereas Disneyland Paris has a higher level of dissatisfaction with lines."

On the other hand, Disneyland Paris has the lowest average rating of 3.98, which could suggest customer dissatisfaction, and the longest reviews at 877.91 characters. This combination of lower ratings and longer reviews might indicate that customers tend to provide more extensive feedback when they are dissatisfied or have specific comments to make.

        "The correlation between review length and rating across the three Disneyland branches is weak and negative. Disneyland Hong Kong shows a correlation of -0.03, indicating almost no relationship between review length and ratings. Disneyland California and Disneyland Paris show correlations of -0.17 and -0.16, respectively, suggesting a weak negative relationship where slightly longer reviews tend to have lower ratings. However, the correlations are weak overall, indicating that review length has little influence on ratings, with other factors likely playing a more significant role."
